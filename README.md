### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Noah and I'm a student at Arizona State University studying Mathematics, Statistics and Economics. On this page you will find various personal data science projects I have worked on out of curiosity, for school or a combination of both.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects utilizing various clustering and classification algos. In particular I'm working on updating a classification model I made for the city of Tempe to model traffic accidents. In the future I plan on building out a full model and simple web application for predicitng UFC fight winners.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML algorithim implmentations, improving my knowledge of statistics + probability and working on my overall data science skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm willing to collaborate on any data science projects!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implementing better SWE practices in my code and data science projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I got into data science & analytics!
