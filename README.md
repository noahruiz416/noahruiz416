### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Noah and I'm a student at Arizona State University studying Mathematics, Statistics and Economics. On this page you will find various personal data science projects I have worked on out of curiosity, for school or a combination of both.

If interested please check out my portfolio site! It hosts one of my most recent projects that allows you to predict UFC fights!
