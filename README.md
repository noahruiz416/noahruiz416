### Hello 👋

My name is Noah and I'm a student at Arizona State University studying Mathematics, Statistics and Economics. On this page you will find various personal data science projects I have worked on out of curiosity, for school or a combination of both.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects utilizing various clustering and classification algos. In particular I'm working on a personal web application that will predict the winner of a UFC fight given certain user input. I plan on using some sort of classification model to predict the probability of a fighter winning or losing. Additionally I plan on creating a basic frontend so users can interact with the site and make predictions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ML algorithim implmentations, improving my knowledge of statistics + probability and working on my overall data science skills.
- 👯 I'm willing to collaborate on any data science projects!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with implementing better SWE practices in my code and data science projects.
- 💬 Ask me about how I got into data science & analytics!
