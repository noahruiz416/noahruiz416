### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Product manager & AI/ML dev passionate about building user-centric solutions.

I currently work in financial services where I develop LLM/NLP applications. In addition I have experience in econometrics, statistical learning and bayesian statistics. On my free time I train muay thai, read/study, and enjoy the occasional glass of wine.
